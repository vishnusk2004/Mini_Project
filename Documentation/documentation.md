## Getting Started

To get started with Job Matchmaker, simply visit our website and navigate to the "Try" page. Here, you'll be prompted to enter your skills, location, and experience level. Once you submit your preferences, our algorithm will analyze our database of job listings to find the best matches for you.

## Technical Architecture

Our Job Matchmaker platform is built using the Django framework and MySQL database. We collect job data from various sources using web scraping techniques and store it in our database. Our custom algorithm then analyzes this data to generate personalized job recommendations for users.

## Usage Examples

1. **Entering Preferences**: Start by entering your skills, location, and experience level on the "Try" page.
   
2. **Viewing Matches**: After submitting your preferences, you'll be presented with a list of companies that match your criteria. Click on each listing to view more details about the job.
